# TerraScan-Replacement-using-Unity
The functions of the TerraScan plug-in of MicroStation needed to be recreated. Unity was used for that purpose. Fast point cloud loading in correct co-ordinate, Basic vectorize, Rotation, Multiple Windows, View change (top, bottom, north, south), Segmentation, and Cross-section were some of the functionalities that have been completed.
